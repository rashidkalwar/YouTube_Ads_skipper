# YouTube_Ads_skipper

The way this Youtube Ads skipper works is that it will require you to have google chrome installed on your system, it is plateform independent so no need to install any OS specific packages, Once you run it, it will open a chrome window with Youtube already opened on it, just search or open any video that you want to watch and if any Ad comes up which is skipable, it will automatically skip that.
